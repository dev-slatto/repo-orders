# Repo-Orders
Read this before creating orders

<h2>Creating orders</h2>
This repo is ment for creating new modules based on the "Template-Repo" repository.
First you need to fork down the repo so you can modify the order-file.
By modifying the JSON-file you can add custom variables so the template suits your needs. 
All fields that doesn't say "Optional" must be filed out.
<br />
<br />
If you choose to not include any information in the "Optional"-fields you need to remove the placeholder text. 
<br />
<br />
See the order-example.json for an example of an complete order.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Submitting orders</h2>
When you are done filling out the JSON-file you can make a pull-request to the master branch here on "repo-orders". 
One of the DevOps will review your file and either accept and merge or give you feedback if something is missing. 
Once the order has been merged with the master your repo will automaticaly been created.
<br />
<br />
See the "Contribute.md" in the main application for how you can connect your module with the main application in development.
<br />
Here you will find a description on submitting your module to production as well.
